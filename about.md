<h3>my history</h3>

<p>I’ve started as a software developer after two years doing Biological Sciences. I was born to be a crazy scientist ( I discovered it when I was 6 ), but I’m too stuborn to accept how things are, so I decided to be a Software Engineer and that was when I my disruption work started.</p>

<p>I got a bachelor in Software Engineering in the <a href="#">Universidade Federal de Goiás</a> in 2016.</p>

<p>My journey began in 2011 when I was a teacher in a really small college in <a href="#">Goiânia</a> and I had to make all my classes diaries by hand. Every two months I had to write dots for 300 students. I then saw that I was in charge of a mission to find a way to make this process better.</p>

<p>My first software never went to production because three months after I drop out from that college and from the University only to enter again, but for a Software Engineer Bachelor this time.</p>

<p>By then I’ve worked with a lot of projects in a lot of different languages like PHP, C#, Java, Javascript, Groovy and Ruby.</p>

<p>With a lot of frameworks like: Grails, Rails, React and NodeJS.</p>

<p>For a lot of plataforms like: Desktop, WEB, Android and Hololens.</p>

<p>I have worked as Linux Devops as well.</p>

<p>I love programming related topics like code quality, software engineer, best practices, design patterns and I write about it always that I have time to.</p>

<p>To be honest, I’m having some trouble remembering right now, so why don’t you just watch <a href="#">my movie</a> and it will answer all your questions.</p>
